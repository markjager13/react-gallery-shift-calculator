# React Gallery Shift Calculator 

This project is an updated version of my Gallery Shift Calculator which was originally written in plain JavaScript. 
The purpose of this project is to solidify my knowledge of React JS by learning how to translate older JS code into cleaner, more efficient React code. 

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
